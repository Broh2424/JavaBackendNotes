**ChatGPT:**

Sure, let's go through each of the mentioned set types in Java and provide examples for their operations.

### 1. HashSet:

A `HashSet` is a collection that uses a hash table for storage. It does not maintain the order of elements and does not allow duplicate elements.

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class HashSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HashSet<String> hashSet = new HashSet<>();

        // Adding elements
        hashSet.add("Apple");
        hashSet.add("Banana");
        hashSet.add("Orange");

        // Duplicates are not allowed
        hashSet.add("Apple");

        // Order is not preserved
        System.out.println("HashSet: " + hashSet);

        // Removing an element
        hashSet.remove("Banana");
        System.out.println("After removing 'Banana': " + hashSet);
    }
}
```

### 2. LinkedHashSet:

`LinkedHashSet` maintains the insertion order and permits null elements.

```java
import java.util.LinkedHashSet;

public class LinkedHashSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedHashSet<String> linkedHashSet = new LinkedHashSet<>();

        // Adding elements
        linkedHashSet.add("Apple");
        linkedHashSet.add("Banana");
        linkedHashSet.add("Orange");

        // Insertion order is preserved
        System.out.println("LinkedHashSet: " + linkedHashSet);

        // Removing an element
        linkedHashSet.remove("Banana");
        System.out.println("After removing 'Banana': " + linkedHashSet);
    }
}
```

### 3. TreeSet:

`TreeSet` uses a tree for storage, and elements are stored in ascending order.

```java
import java.util.TreeSet;

public class TreeSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TreeSet<String> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();

        // Adding elements
        treeSet.add("Apple");
        treeSet.add("Banana");
        treeSet.add("Orange");

        // Elements are stored in ascending order
        System.out.println("TreeSet: " + treeSet);

        // Removing an element
        treeSet.remove("Banana");
        System.out.println("After removing 'Banana': " + treeSet);
    }
}
```

### 4. SortedSet:

`SortedSet` is an interface that provides a total ordering on its elements. `TreeSet` is an implementation of `SortedSet`.

```java
import java.util.SortedSet;
import java.util.TreeSet;

public class SortedSetExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SortedSet<String> sortedSet = new TreeSet<>();

        // Adding elements
        sortedSet.add("Apple");
        sortedSet.add("Banana");
        sortedSet.add("Orange");

        // Elements are stored in ascending order
        System.out.println("SortedSet: " + sortedSet);

        // Removing an element
        sortedSet.remove("Banana");
        System.out.println("After removing 'Banana': " + sortedSet);
    }
}
```

These examples demonstrate basic operations such as adding, removing, and printing elements for each type of set in Java. Keep in mind that the `SortedSet` is an interface, and `TreeSet` is its implementation.

| `remove(Object o)` | Removes the specified element from the set. |
| `size()` | Returns the number of elements in the set. |
| `isEmpty()` | Returns true if the set contains no elements. |
| `contains(Object o)` | Returns true if the set contains the specified element. |
| `clear()` | Removes all elements from the set. |

#### LinkedHashSet

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `add(E e)` | Adds the specified element to the set. |
| `remove(Object o)` | Removes the specified element from the set. |
| `size()` | Returns the number of elements in the set. |
| `isEmpty()` | Returns true if the set contains no elements. |
| `contains(Object o)` | Returns true if the set contains the specified element. |
| `clear()` | Removes all elements from the set. |

#### TreeSet

| Method | Description |

| `add(E e)` | Adds the specified element to the set. |
| `remove(Object o)` | Removes the specified element from the set. |
| `size()` | Returns the number of elements in the set. |
| `isEmpty()` | Returns true if the set contains no elements. |
| `contains(Object o)` | Returns true if the set contains the specified element. |
| `clear()` | Removes all elements from the set. |

#### SortedSet (Implemented by TreeSet)

| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `comparator()` | Returns the comparator used to order the elements, or `null` if the natural ordering is used. |
| `first()` | Returns the first (lowest) element. |
| `last()` | Returns the last (highest) element. |
| `headSet(E toElement)` | Returns a view of the portion of the set strictly less than the given element. |
| `tailSet(E fromElement)` | Returns a view of the portion of the set greater than or equal to the given element. |
| `subSet(E fromElement, E toElement)` | Returns a view of the portion of the set that is between the specified elements (inclusive). |

These are some of the commonly used methods for each type of set in Java. Keep in mind that these are just a subset of the available methods, and there may be additional methods provided by the Set interface or its implementing classes.
