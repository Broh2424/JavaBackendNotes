**ChatGPT:**

Certainly! Let's create a similar structure for the `List` interface in Java, including an overview, examples for different types of lists, and interview questions. We'll also include tables summarizing the methods for each list type.

### List Interface

* **Ordered:** Yes
* **Indexed:** Yes
* **Duplicates Allowed:** Yes

### ArrayList

* Implements the `List` interface and uses an array for dynamic sizing.
* Provides fast random access and is good for read-heavy operations.

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class ArrayListExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayList<String> arrayList = new ArrayList<>();

        // Adding elements
        arrayList.add("Apple");
        arrayList.add("Banana");
        arrayList.add("Orange");

        // Accessing elements by index
        System.out.println("Element at index 1: " + arrayList.get(1));

        // Removing an element
        arrayList.remove("Banana");
        System.out.println("After removing 'Banana': " + arrayList);
    }
}
```

### LinkedList

* Implements the `List` interface and uses a doubly-linked list for storage.
* Good for frequent insertions and removals.

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class LinkedListExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LinkedList<String> linkedList = new LinkedList<>();

        // Adding elements
        linkedList.add("Apple");
        linkedList.add("Banana");
        linkedList.add("Orange");

        // Adding at specific index
        linkedList.add(1, "Grapes");

        // Removing an element
        linkedList.remove("Banana");
        System.out.println("After removing 'Banana': " + linkedList);
    }
}
```

### Vector

* Similar to `ArrayList` but synchronized, making it thread-safe.
* Considered legacy; `ArrayList` is generally preferred unless thread safety is required.

```java
import java.util.Vector;

public class VectorExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Vector<String> vector = new Vector<>();

        // Adding elements
        vector.add("Apple");
        vector.add("Banana");
        vector.add("Orange");

        // Accessing elements by index
        System.out.println("Element at index 1: " + vector.get(1));

        // Removing an element
        vector.remove("Banana");
        System.out.println("After removing 'Banana': " + vector);
    }
}
```

### Stack

* Extends `Vector` and represents a last-in, first-out (LIFO) stack of objects.
* Includes standard push and pop operations.

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class StackExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Stack<String> stack = new Stack<>();

        // Pushing elements
        stack.push("Apple");
        stack.push("Banana");
        stack.push("Orange");

        // Popping the top element
        String poppedElement = stack.pop();
        System.out.println("Popped element: " + poppedElement);
        System.out.println("Stack after pop: " + stack);
    }
}
```
